        <p class="testemonials">My babies had the best time with Helena today!
          It had been WAY too long for Kodas nail trim but she knew just how to keep him distracted
          and calm during the whole time! She was phenomenal with both of my fur babies and we will
          be seeing her every month from here on.
          100% recommend her services.
          <br>

        <p class="testemonials"> Helena is an amazing gift to the pet care world! I couldn’t be more happy than when my
          dog
          was in her care.
          She’s kind, compassionate, professional, and just a joy to be around! Thank you Helena for everything!!!

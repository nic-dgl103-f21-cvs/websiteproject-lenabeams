      <h3>Importance of Dog Nail Trims</h3>
      <p>
        In a perfect world, dogs should get their nails trimmed about once a
        month, but life can get busy and things like this can easily get
        forgotten. However, if it has been a long time since your pups last nail
        trim, and their nails aren’t getting worn down on pavement, they do
        become a risk of getting pulled off, or becoming painfully outgrown and
        having the quicks ‘grow -out’ with the nail. This results, in
        uncomfortable long nails, that touch the ground with force every time
        they take a step, (ouch!) which long-term, could alter the way their
        foot is placed on the ground, and making the paw look ‘splayed’ out.
        Unfortunately, once the quick is grown out, you can’t trim off as much
        as you’d like, or you risk cutting their quicks and they will bleed. If
        it gets to this point, which is very common, you have to ‘train’ the
        quick to recede back with regular nail trimmings- and this could take a
        while, but it is worth it for the comfort of your dog. A good rule of
        thumb to follow is, if you can hear your dog’s toenails hit the ground
        as they walk, they need a trim.

      <h3>About Cat Nail Trims</h3>
      <P>
        Cats don’t always need Nail Trims, if they are hunters, or outside cats
        that don’t often roam around indoors. However, when your feline friend
        starts scratching up your furniture, carpet- or even you, that would be
        a good indication to think about getting them trimmed. Some cats aren’t
        the biggest fan while taking away their talons, but once it’s done, they
        really don’t care at all. It’s best to get them acclimated to having
        their paws touched and toes trimmed as a kitten to avoid the fear of it,
        but if this is not the case, I have a few tricks up my sleeve, and am up
        for the task.</P>

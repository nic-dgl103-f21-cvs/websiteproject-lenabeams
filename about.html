      <p>
        Hi, I’m Helena! I’m here to offer you my Minimal stress pet care
        services, with the convenience of me coming to your home. I am
        originally from Alberta and moved to Quadra Island, BC as a teenager
        with my family. Once on my own I moved to Campbell River, and eventually
        started working as a receptionist at local vet hospital, and eventually
        carried on working there as an Animal Care Aide. I have always had a
        very strong love for animals and making them feel safe and loved. I love
        going for hikes and exploring the island, as well as doing art, music
        and loving up my cat, Alba on my spare time. I have worked in the
        veterinary industry as an ACA, alongside many very inspirational,
        intelligent, and gentle techs and Dr’s who have massively influenced my
        stress-free approach to animal care. Currently, I am attending college
        in Comox for graphic design, and have strongly missed the contact and
        relationships I have with animals and their loving owners. I decided I
        wanted to have my own mobile pet care service to keep that contact, and
        as covid-19 has severely impacted getting pets in on a timely manner for
        simple appointments like nail trims which are extremely important to
        keep up with, I knew I could help out. Feel free to reach out with any
        questions or concerns and I will do my best to get back to as quickly as
        possible!

      <h3>FAQ's</h3>
      <dl> <!-- boxes with rounded corners seperating each FAQ's with nbsp--> <!--Sarah-for now is it okay to use ul inside lists-->
        <dt>What do you use to trim nails? <dd> Good old reliant Nail trimmers!
           The most efficient way of getting them done, so your pet can get back to relaxing as soon as possible!</dd> </dt>
        <dt>How long do I wait between my Dog’s nail trims? <dd>Depends on the dog! If you have been diligent with nail trims,
           usually around every 4-6 weeks is plenty. If your dog’s quicks have grown out 
           if you’ve been unable to upkeep with the trimming, we would have to do more frequent work to get 
           them on a more maintainable schedule. I like to assess each dogs’ nails at the time of the visit to best determine
           what would work best for that specific dog. </dd> </li>
        <dt>How long do I wait between my Cats nail trims? <dd>If you are concerned with your cat scratching your furniture or they end
           up scratching you, about once every month should do, dependent on the cat!</dd> </dt>
        <dt>How will you keep my animal still? <dd> I do rely on the owner to do the holding/distraction of the pet, 
           if you are unable to do so, maybe as a friend or relative to assist you. While you are holding, I can then 
           recommend holds to make the process as stress free as possible! Be sure to have lots of treats on hand!</dd> </dt>
        <dt>What if my animal is aggressive? <dd> I have plenty of experience and techniques I use for animals who aren’t 
            a fan of being fondled! I do carry cloth muzzles for dogs with me if necessary, and a cone for cats 
           (having a towel handy can be helpful too).</dd> </dt>
        <dt>How far ahead should I book? <dd> To get the date or time you are looking for, try to book 2 weeks out,
           but I can try to get you in as soon as possible!</dd></dt>

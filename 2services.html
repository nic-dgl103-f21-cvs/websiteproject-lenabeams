       <h3> More about My Services </h3>

          <p>Home-visit nail trims, limit the stress of going to the groomer or vet office.
             This allows them to be in the comfort of their own safe space, and the convenience of me, coming to you,
             for the affordable price of <strong> $25.00 per pet. </strong> If you want to add on additional services to a nail trim appointment, I will do so at a discounted rate. </p>

            <p>I practice minimal stress services and will try to make the situation as comfortable as possible for you and your pet. 
              Please have treats, their favorite toy or anything that makes them feel comfortable handy. 
              Since I am a one-woman show, I would appreciate your help (the owner- or even a friend/family member) 
              to hold while I get the job done.
              I will direct you with the best, most comfortable way to hold, and with someone they love holding them, 
              they will feel a whole lot safer.
              I will only use muzzles if it is necessary and there is risk of injury- don’t worry,
               my cloth muzzles don’t hurt at all and are more of a distraction than anything to your pet! 
            </p>
